## Description
REST: 
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a [software architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Representational State Transfer (REST) is a [software architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating [Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) and Web APIs.

  API:
  In computer programming, Programming Interface which allows software applications to communicate with each other via **API** calls.
An application programming interface is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software.

This project uses a flask server programmed in python, to make API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc) and test them using Postman. The server uses REST architecture for requests made by and responses to, the client.
Most Web browsers by default serve for GET request. However to test other requests, another API called Postman is used.

Generally a  server contains a database which contains information required by the client. However in this project a JSON file containing some information is used as a database.

### Technology

These are the following packages, tools and platforms used in this project:

*  [Flask] -Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2                and good intentions

*  [Python] - It is a popular, easy to pick up programming language and fun to play with.

*  [Postman] - **Postman** is currently one of the most popular tools used in **API** testing.
*  [JSON] - It is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
  

## Setup

  

##### This was build on Windows 8.1.

These were the pre-requisities :

##### ### **Install Postman Native Application:**

**Step 1:**  To install Postman, go to the  [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)  and click Download for Mac / Windows / Linux depending on your platform.

Once it is downloaded, you can find your downloaded file in the default downloads location of your system. If you are using Chrome browser, the downloaded file will appear at the bottom of the browser as shown in the below image.

**Step 2:**  Open Postman windows 64 bit exe file to install it on your system.
